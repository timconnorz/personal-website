# Video Series: An Explanation of Automated Market Makers

Here are some youtube videos I recorded where I explain the concept of Automated Market Makers, first by reviewing order books, and then explaining how AMMs take them to the next level.

I made these for a course we were making at 101.xyz on this topic. Please enjoy!
