# This DAO Has Gone Too Far: The Merit Circle Fiasco

Note: This post has been adapted from a thread I wrote on Twitter. I've added this intro section as an explainer to those who may be unfamiliar with DAOs. If you are, I promise you'll still find this to be an interesting story.

## Introduction to DAOs

If you're not familiar with the term, DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and it refers to a method of online social organization where the rules of governance run as autonomous code on the blockchain. That's a mouthful, so let's explain it further. (Web3 vets, feel free to skip)

Consider a large college club. There's a president, maybe a vice-president, and occasionally there will be elections to recycle those in power. There's also probably policies defining membership and expulsion. In the entrepreneurship club at UCLA, we stored these governance rules in a google doc and enforced them somewhat arbitrarily according to the whims of those in power. And it worked fine.

But it would definitely not have been fine if our org suddenly grew to 20x the size. Ambitious organizations with hundreds of energetic participants can become chaotic without a carefully crafted set of policies and bountiful will to enforce them. To state the obvious, this is a challenge for pretty much any group of people.

That's why, when blockchain tech enabled the creation of autonomous code, it didn't take long for people to consider how it could be applied to social governance. Thus DAOs were born.

DAOs define their operating procedures as blockchain code: membership policies, voting rights, and when applicable, payment distributions. Unlike other forms of organizations, a well-crafted DAO can credibly claim to be incorruptible.

...At least that's the theory.

Unfortunately, it seems time to deflate the DAO optimism a little bit, because what happened recently is, in my opinion, a perfect example of how good ideas like this can go so wrong.

## Merit Circle DAO vs YGG

May 23rd, 2022: A new proposal appears on the governance forums of a DAO called Merit Cirle DAO, whose mandate was (and still is) to cultivate the web3 gaming ecosystem by making investments and building games. This particular proposal stands out immediately:

‚Äúaims to cancel YGG‚Äôs SAFT, refund their initial investment, and remove their seed tokens‚Äù

They wanted to cut YGG out before the unlock date when they could theoretically start selling their tokens

It didn't take long for other members to come across this hot topic, and although I personally find it to be... a questionable idea... it was nearly unanimously well-received!

Neither the original post nor the majority of comments made any mention of the fact that this was a contractual breach.

There was one person who popped in to mention that it would destroy their reputation and get them sued, but no one seemed to care.

Meanwhile the investor in question, @YieldGuild aka YGG, made a post basically saying:

‚Äú‚ÄúUH WTF. This was an investor agreement. We‚Äôre not required to give you anything except money. You can‚Äôt just change the rules and push us out.‚Äù‚Äù

![Medium](/merit-circle/medium.png)

And the core team (legally organized as a company called ‚ÄúMerit Circle Limited‚Äù) commented on the proposal saying:

‚ÄúWe would like to honor all agreements, however‚Ä¶ the DAO holds the ultimate power‚Äù

‚Ä¶I bet those investor agreements signed by ‚ÄúMerit Circle Ltd‚Äù say otherwise

![Dear](/merit-circle/dear.png)

![Considerations](/merit-circle/considerations.png)

Despite naysayers the idea was popular, so it was put to an official vote and IT PASSED

106 for. 16 against ü´†

![Info2](/merit-circle/info2.png)

Immediately a new proposal popped up, the core team was trying to make this work:

‚ÄúHow about we at least allow them to take a reduced return on their investment‚Äù

(This would be paying them ~30% of what they were owed)

![MIP14](/merit-circle/mip14.png)

The proposal passed unanimously (???) and it was decided that the DAO would buy out YGG at a token price of $0.32

The token was, and is still is trading around $1.00 on the open market

They got 1.75M instead of 5.2M

![Info](/merit-circle/info.png)

I am not a member of this DAO, nor super familiar with YGG, but it‚Äôs hard to see this as anything other than a horrendous stain on the reputation of web3

We cannot build the future we want without the help of the outside world.

This is a nascent industry, still struggling in many ways. We need all the help we can get.

Merit Circle DAO may not need outside support anymore, but many other projects do

And now they‚Äôve made it harder for earlier projects to get the capital they need.

Investors might rightfully ask ‚Äúwhat if your DAO decides to fuck us‚Äù

The author of the proposal talked about the need for decentralization saying:

‚ÄúDecentralization is about freedom. The freedom to do as one desires, unbound by anything and everything.‚Äù

I strongly disagree.

![Dear2](/merit-circle/dear2.png)

Decentralization is not about ruthless self-interest.

It‚Äôs about collaboration.

And if we want this industry to continue to thrive, then we‚Äôll need to collaborate with the off-chain world too.

That includes honoring legal agreements with investors
