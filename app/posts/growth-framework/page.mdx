# The Growth Framework for All Startups

What does growth mean? How do we measure it? What are the different types of growth?

I prefer to answer these questions using a growth model borrowed from Phil Libin, who co-founded Evernote.

The power of this framework lies in its comprehensiveness. It places every single person on earth into one of five buckets. Over time, each person will move between the buckets along one of 14 lines.

Every person on earth enters starts in the 'Never used' bucket. Most will stay there, moving along line 11 back to the same bucket.

Those who try your product will move along line 1 into the 'First time users' bucket. After that, they'll proceed along one of three connecting paths:

- Along line 2 to 'Inactive users'
- Along line 3 to 'Low value users'
- Along line 4 to 'High value users'

You get the idea.

When you're implementing this growth framework into your own business, you'll need to pick a suitable timeframe that will define your lines and buckets. Many startups will find it useful to start with a 30-day window.

That would mean that users have to use the product at least once every 30 days to qualify as a "low value" or "high value" user. It also means that when they first use the product, they will remain in the "first time users" bucket for 30 days. If they use the product a lot but stop cold on day 29, they will go straight to 'Inactive users'

Another variable you need to decide is what determines a "high value" from "low value" user.

For social media startups, a high value user might be someone who posts content at least once within the time window. Low value users would be people who read content at least once, but don't post anything.

You get the idea.
